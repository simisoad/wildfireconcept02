# WildfireConcept02

After the “Proof of Concept” from “WildFireConcept” (https://nomis3d.itch.io/wildfireconcept), I want to take the game to a new level.

- Huge game world based on OSM data (vector and raster data)
- Dynamic streaming of OSM data

My goal is to develop an RTS game where you have to fight realistic forest fires. 
The focus is on coordinating firefighting planes and helicopters.

Current status of the project:
Prototype for streaming OSM data.

Important!

The /db directory is missing here on GitHub, which contains the OSM vector and raster data as .mbtiles files. However, these are much too large for GitHub.
I need to see if I can use GitHub LFS for this.

The project uses the following add-ons:
-geo-tile-loader
-godot-sqlite
